# Scraper
Used Python to create a program that scrapes data from Glassdoor's website into an Excel spreadsheet to perform an analysis and find links between employee job satisfaction, employee productivity and overall company productivity.
To run this program create a virtual environment in python then run pip freeze>requirement.txt thenn install all listed libraries in the .txt file

NB Glassdoor requires the user's username and email address, also you need to insert the page you want to scrape
